# Working with Prompts

## Fundamentals

- **Be Specific and Detailed** - clear, explicit instructions produce better results than vague requests
- **Provide Context** - share relevant background, constraints, and goals upfront
- **Assign Roles and Expertise** - give Claude a specific persona or domain expertise for better context
- **Use Examples** - show what you want with concrete examples when possible
- **Break Down Complex Tasks** - divide large requests into smaller, manageable steps
- **Iterate and Refine** - start with a basic prompt, then refine based on results

## Advanced

- **Use Chain of Thought** - ask Claude to think step-by-step for complex reasoning tasks
- **Leverage Prompt Templates** - use structured frameworks and patterns for consistent, repeatable results
- **Specify Output Format** - define exact structure you need (JSON, tables, markdown, etc.)
- **Provide Multiple Examples** - use few-shot learning with 2-3 examples for pattern recognition
- **Set Clear Constraints** - explicitly state what to avoid, boundaries, and requirements
