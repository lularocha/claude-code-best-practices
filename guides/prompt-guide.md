# Working with Prompts

Effective prompting is the foundation of successful collaboration with Claude. The quality of your prompts directly impacts the quality of Claude's responses. 

## Fundamentals

- **Be Specific** - clear, explicit, detailed instructions produce better results than vague requests
- **Provide Context** - share relevant background, constraints, and goals upfront
- **Assign Roles and Expertise** - define specific persona or domain expertise for better context
- **Use Examples** - show what you want with concrete examples when possible
- **Break Down Complex Tasks** - divide large requests into smaller, manageable steps
- **Iterate and Refine** - start with a basic prompt, then refine based on results

## Advanced

- **Use Chain of Thought** - ask Claude to think step-by-step for complex reasoning tasks
- **Specify Output Format** - define exact structure you need (JSON, tables, markdown, etc.)
- **Provide Multiple Examples** - use few-shot learning with 2-3 examples for pattern recognition
- **Set Clear Constraints** - explicitly state what to avoid, boundaries, and requirements
- **Use Prompt Templates** - for example from [Anthropic's Prompt Library](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/prompt-library/library)
- **Claude Console Tool** - Build and test with [Prompt Generator](https://console.anthropic.com/)
- **Advanced Prompt Engineereing** - Look at Anthropic's [Prompt Engineering Guide](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/overview) for comprehensive techniques and strategies
